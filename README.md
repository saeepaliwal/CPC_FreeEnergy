# CPC_FreeEnergy
Free Energy toolbox to accompany Computational Psychiatry Course
Included are the scripts I used to generate my plots, a plot prettifier (purty_plot.m) and the slides from my talk.

The main scripts included in this package are:
cpc_free_energy.y: Wrapper script to spcecify toy model, run variational inversion and generate plots.

To run the toolbox, in MatLAB simply run:
```
cpc_free_energy
```

Please email me at paliwal@biomed.ee.ethz.ch with any questions and interest! Hope you enjoy the toolbox!
